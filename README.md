# BRAILLE metagenomics binder
An R [binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) environment built to work with our [OSF site](https://osf.io/uhk48/wiki/home/) for this project. 

**Click this launch binder badge to access the environment:**  
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AstrobioMike/binder-BRAILLE/main?urlpath=rstudio)

This session only lasts as long as we're using it. Files can be uploaded to it and downloaded from it, but nothing will remain on the session/in the environment when it sits idle for too long (I think this might be like 10 minutes) or after it is closed. Clicking the launch badge again will open a new one with no retained files or work.

To get started, once the RStudio environment opens, click on the **`explore.R`** file in the bottom right panel under the "Files" tab ðŸ™‚
